# Regression-algorithms-on-Gadget_dataset
Applied Linear, Multiple, Polynomial, Decision Tree, and Random Forest Regression models on a tech gadgets rating dataset to analyze and predict customer ratings. 📊🧠

# 📈 Tech Gadgets Rating Prediction

This project focuses on applying various regression techniques to predict the **ratings of tech gadgets** using a dataset containing features like price, brand popularity, reviews, and more.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Using the `tech_gadgets_rating_dataset.xls` file, this analysis implements and compares the performance of:

- 🔹 Linear Regression
- 🔹 Multiple Linear Regression
- 🔹 Polynomial Regression
- 🔹 Decision Tree Regression
- 🔹 Random Forest Regression

The goal is to understand how different features influence gadget ratings and determine which regression model provides the most accurate predictions.

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset includes:
- **Features**: Price, Features Score, Popularity, Review Count, etc.
- **Target**: Gadget Rating (typically out of 5)

> 📌 Note: Data preprocessing like null value treatment, encoding, and scaling were applied before training models.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for all regression models)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation Metrics

Models were evaluated using:
- ✅ R² Score
- ✅ Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- ✅ Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- ✅ Visualization (scatter plots & residuals)

---

## 📈 Results Summary

| Model               | R² Score |
|--------------------|----------|
| Linear Regression  | X.XX     |
| Multiple Regression| X.XX     |
| Polynomial         | X.XX     |
| Decision Tree      | X.XX     |
| Random Forest      | X.XX     |

> Replace `X.XX` with your actual scores

---

## 📌 Conclusion

Random Forest Regression provided the best performance in terms of accuracy, handling both non-linearity and feature interactions effectively.
